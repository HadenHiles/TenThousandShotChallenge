# Weekly Achievements Feature Plan

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Motivate users to diversify their training and improve consistency by providing weekly achievements.
- **Location:** Achievements will be surfaced in the Start tab for easy access and tracking.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. Achievement Generation
- Each week, generate a set of achievements for every user.
- Target shot types the user has not practiced recently (based on their shot history).
- Example basic achievement: "Take 25 backhands in your next 3 shooting sessions."
- Pro users receive tailored achievements based on their accuracy stats (e.g., "Achieve 70% accuracy on wrist shots this week").
- Achievements should be reasonable and encourage variety and improvement.

### 2. Data Model
- **Achievement:**
  - `id`, `title`, `description`, `shotType`, `goalType` (e.g., count, accuracy), `goalValue`, `timeFrame` (e.g., week), `completed`, `dateAssigned`, `dateCompleted`, `userId`, `proLevel` (bool)
- Store achievements in Firestore under each user (e.g., `userAchievements` collection).

### 3. UI Integration
- Display current weekly achievements in the Start tab.
- Show progress (e.g., shots taken, accuracy, sessions completed).
- Achievements are automatically checked off when the user completes the required actions; there is no manual check-off option.
- Provide feedback and rewards (badges, points, etc.) for completion.

### 4. Achievement Assignment Logic
- Run a weekly job (cloud function or app logic) to assign new achievements:
  - Analyze user shot history to find under-practiced shot types.
  - For pro users, analyze accuracy stats to set tailored goals.
  - Assign 2â€“4 achievements per week, mixing basic and pro-level goals.

### 5. Gamification & Rewards
- Award badges, points, or other incentives for completing achievements.
- Track achievement streaks for consecutive weeks in which the user completes every assigned achievement.
- Show achievement streak and achievement history in the profile tab.

### 6. Testing & QA
- Test achievement assignment logic for variety and fairness.
- Test UI for progress tracking and completion feedback.
